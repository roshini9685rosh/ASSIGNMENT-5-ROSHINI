# ASSIGNMENT-5-ROSHINI
Clustering on Leukemia Dataset by administering both Elbow and Silhouette methods.

# Leukemia Prediction Using K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is a method of vector quantization that aims to partition a given data into clusters with the idea that each observation in a cluster will serve as a prototype to the cluster.The number of clusters is determined by excecuting the elbow method and silhouette method on the leukemia.csv dataset.

# Pre-requisites
We need jupiter notebook for writting the code and a github to host the project.

# Libraries
Before coding we need to install the following libraries:
 pandas
 numpy
 matplotlib
 sklearn
 
 # Result
 The clustering will effectively give the number of clusters and thereby assist in the prediction of leukemia.
